# State

The SATOSA proxy uses a secure cookie to save state between different steps in
the transaction flow. The state is encrypted using an AES-256 cipher with
CBC mode and a random IV.
Through a complete flow, the state will at some point contain/have contained
the information described below. Additional information may have been stored
in the state by other plugins.

## SATOSA proxy
